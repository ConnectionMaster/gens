What is Gens/GS?

Gens v2.15.5/GS-m5.1 is David Korth's fork of Gens, initially based
on Gens for Linux v2.15.5. The number after the "m" indicates the
milestone. Releases are usually made after a significant new
feature has been added, with minor releases if a major bug is found.

What's new in Gens/GS v2.15.5/GS-m5.1?

Gens/GS v2.15.5/GS-m5.1 has several bugfixes and improvements.

Notable improvements:

- RAR archives can now be used via an external RAR binary. You must have RAR
  installed in order to use this feature. (Windows users can install WinRAR,
  which includes the command-line rar.exe.)

- You can now drag a ROM file onto the Gens window to open it.

Notable bugfixes:

- [Win32] The lag issue seen on some computers should be fixed.

- [Win32] Fixed joystick POV support.

- [32X] PWM audio no longer "clicks" when it isn't in use.

- [Debugger] The VDP debugger now scrolls all the way to the last VRAM line,
  0xFE00-0xFFFF. Previously, it would only scroll to line 0xFC00-0xFDFF. This
  bug was reported by djohe in #retro.

- [Regression from m5] Gens no longer creates blank SRAM files for games that
  don't use SRAM. This bug was reported by Delta on the Sonic Retro forums.

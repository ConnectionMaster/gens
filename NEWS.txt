What is Gens/GS?

Gens v2.15.5/GS-r7 is David Korth's fork of Gens, initially based
on Gens for Linux v2.15.5. The number after the "r" indicates the
Gens/GS release. Releases are usually made after a significant new
feature has been added, with minor releases if a major bug is found.

================================================================

Release 7 introduces the following new features:

- Mega Drive Plugins v1.0.0. This major update to the plugins system
  adds support for external plugins (.dll on Windows, .so on Linux),
  as well as support for more than just rendering plugins.

- doc/MDP.txt contains the MDP Interface Specifiction Version 1.0.0.
  This document is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License v1.3.

- The Game Genie functionality has been moved to an MDP plugin. It now supports
  8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit patch codes, and uses a new patch code file format.
  Old patch code files are supported for loading; however, they will be written
  in the new format when saved. Later versions will add support for patching
  CPU address spaces other than the main MC68000.

- New MDP Plugin: VDP Layer Options. This lets you adjust the visible layers
  on screen, so e.g. you can hide sprites, swap scroll priorities, and lock
  the palette to prevent color changes.

- New MDP Plugin: Sonic Gens. This lets you view various information in
  memory in several Sonic games. Sonic Gens was originally written by LOst as a
  standalone version of Gens.

- New renderers:
  - EPX (ported from Gens Rerecording)
  - EPX Plus (ported from Gens Rerecording)
  - Super 2xSaI (ported from Gens Plus)
  - Super Eagle (ported from Gens Plus)

- [Win32] Ported the GDI video backend from Gens Plus. It still has
  a few bugs, but it mostly works.

- Extended controller configuration format. The new configuration format
  allows for up to 128 axes, 256 buttons, and 64 POV hats, whereas the
  old configuration format only allowed for 6 axes [5 axes on Win32],
  112 buttons, and 4 POV hats. This mainly affects the Linux version, since
  Linux usually reports all axes as axes instead of mapping some axes to
  POV hats, and some newer controllers (e.g. the Xbox 360 controller) have
  more than 6 axes. Older configurations are automatically updated to use
  the new controller configuration format.

- The reverse-engineered 32X firmware, written by DevSter, is now included
  in Gens/GS. If you do not have the original Sega 32X firmware files, the
  reverse-engineered ones are used instead.

- Added SH2 DMA support for PWM audio. Thanks to Joseph Fenton for
  submitting a patch.

- [Win32] Joysticks connected after loading Gens/GS will now be detected
  in the Controller Configuration dialog.

- WAV dumping has been reimplemented.

Release 7 fixes the following bugs:

- Dragging and dropping a ROM image onto the Gens/GS window will now
  synchronize the menus. This bug was reported by Tets on the Sonic
  Retro forums.

- Loading a GSX savestate file that is not in GSX format will now show
  an error instead of crashing. Apparently, Gens Plus GZips its savestate
  files when saving by default. This bug was reported by SoNick in #retro.

- [GTK+] Copied g_uri_unescape_string() (and dependent functions) from
  GLib 2.18.4 into Gens/GS. This function was introduced in GLib 2.16,
  but Gens/GS should be compatible with versions of GLib 2.4 and later.

- Multitap support has been ported from x86 assembler to C. In the process,
  both Sega Teamplayer and 4-Way Play support have been improved. Notably,
  Teamplayer now works on "NBA Jam" and "NBA Jam TE", and 4-Way Play now
  works (sometimes) on "Triple Play '96". A complete list of tested multitap
  games can be found in doc/teamplayer.txt .

Release 7 has the following low-level code changes:

- The video, audio, and input subsystems have been ported back to C.
  The C++ system was too awkward and had too much overhead.

- Similarly, the decompression subsystem has been ported back to C.
  In addition, the LZMA SDK is now built into Gens/GS, so 7z archives
  can be read without an external 7z binary.

- Initial port of the Z80 emulator to C. The Z80 emulator has been moved
  out of the src/gens directory and into its own directory, src/mdZ80.
  Currently, the only functions that have been ported to C are the helper
  functions. The actual emulation code is currently being worked on in the
  mdZ80 branch in the Gens/GS git repository.

What is Gens/GS?

Gens v2.15.5/GS-m6 is David Korth's fork of Gens, initially based
on Gens for Linux v2.15.5. The number after the "m" indicates the
milestone. Releases are usually made after a significant new
feature has been added, with minor releases if a major bug is found.

================================================================

Milestone 6 introduces the following new features:

- Mega Drive Plugins v0.1.0. The initial version of the plugin system
  only supports render plugins and only if they're built into the
  main executable. A later version will add support for external
  plugins (.dll on Windows, .so on Linux), as well as more types of
  plugins, such as netplay, debugging, and movie recording.

- doc/MDP.txt contains the MDP Interface Specifiction Version 0.1.0.

- All renderers now support 32-bit color.

- [Win32] hq2x has been fixed.

- Scale2x now has optimized C and x86 mmx implementations.

- New renderers: Scale3x, Scale4x, hq3x, hq4x.

- Added a 32-bit color asm version of the Fast Blur effect, with mmx
  optimizations if available.

Milestone 6 fixes the following bugs:

- [SDL] Ctrl+Q did not work in fullscreen mode.

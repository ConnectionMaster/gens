================================================================

1. Format Characters

The IRC Reporter supports format strings. Each format entry starts with
a percent sign ('%'), followed by zero or more lowercase letter modifiers,
and ending with an uppercase letter or special character as the format code.

For format codes that use regions, the emulator's region is used by default,
unless a modifier is specified.

Format codes available:

%	Literal percent sign.

S	System name.
	'a': Use an abbreviation instead of the full name.
	'd': Use Japanese system name.
	'o': Use American system name.

T	ROM title as given by the ROM header. Uses the emulator's country
	code settings to determine which title to use as first priority.
	'd': Use domestic as default.
	'o': Use overseas as default.
	'l': Use the locked-on ROM, if available.

C	CRC32 checksum.
N	ROM serial number.
	'l': Use the locked-on ROM, if available.

Z	ROM size, in megabits.
	'k': Use kilobits.
	'b': Use bits.
	'c': Use bytes instead of bits. (affects both 'k' and 'b')
	'y': Print units.
	'z': Print unit abbreviations. (takes priority over 'y')

D	Build date, if available.
	'l': Use the locked-on ROM, if available.

[	Only display if a ROM is locked on.
]	End of previous.

Some escape sequences are also supported:

\\	Literal backslash.
\xFF	Hexadecimal byte.

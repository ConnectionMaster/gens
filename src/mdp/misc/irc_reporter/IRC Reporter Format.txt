================================================================

1. Format Characters

The IRC Reporter supports format strings. Each format entry starts with
a percent sign ('%'), followed by zero or more lowercase letter modifiers,
and ending with an uppercase letter or special character as the format code.

Format entries available:

%	Literal percent sign.

S	System name.
	'a': Use an abbreviation instead of the full name.

T	ROM title as given by the ROM header. Uses the emulator's country
	code settings to determine which title to use as first priority.
	'd': Use domestic as default.
	'l': Use the locked-on ROM, if available.

C	CRC32 checksum.
N	Serial number.
	'l': Use the locked-on ROM, if available.

S	ROM size, in megabits.
	'k': Use kilobits.
	'b': Use bits.
	'c': Use bytes instead of bits. (affects both 'k' and 'b')

D	Build date, if available.

[	Only display if a ROM is locked on.
]	End of previous.

Some escape sequences are also supported:

\\	Literal backslash.
\xFF	Hexadecimal byte.

High-Level TODO:
- Rewrite GTK+ UI
- Move most global variables to global Settings struct
- Port all Gens ReRecording changes
- Add Win32 support
- Add Qt4 UI
- Convert all code to C++ with classes, etc
- Convert from automake to CMake
- Add VGM dumping support

Low Priority:
- Add MacOS X Aqua UI

Emulator TODO:
- Fix VRAM overwrite bug, as seen in Sonic 2 Delta. Gens doesn't overwrite the VRAM, but Kega and the actual MD do.
- Fix Illegal Address bug. Gens doesn't crash, but Kega and the actual MD do. (Possible: Make an option to crash on illegal address.)
- CD audio fixes in Gens Re-Recording r65, r66, etc.

- Sprite priority bug (from #retro)
<+Sik> See, there's a priority flag for each tile in the plans and each sprite
<+Sik> However, it only works between planes. Sprites are ordered by the chain list.
<+Sik> So a sprite with low priority flag can still appear over one with a high priority flag.
<+Sik> Guess what happens when you have that situation and it's mixed with a high priority in the scroll planes.
<+Sik> Hint: put a green block in Sonic 1 in the overground areas. Put it into the lava so it floats on it. Wait until it collisions with a platform...

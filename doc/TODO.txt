TODO for Gens/GS m6:
- Finish initial plugin implementation. (Internal plugins only.)
- [MDP] Add plugin configuration save/load based on MDP UUID.
- [MDP] Add an optional plugin icon variable. (32x32 PNG)
- [MDPT_RENDER] hq?x: Pre-calculate the destination pitch adjustment instead
  of re-calculating it on each line.
- [MDPT_RENDER] asm: Apply optimization tips from http://www.mark.masmcode.com/.
  In particular, reduce dependencies.
- [MDP] Add a flags field to MDP_RenderInfo_t, which will allow for something
  like MDP_RENDERINFO_INTERLACED_EVEN and MDP_RENDERINFO_INTERLACED_ODD,
  indicating interlaced frames. This will require MDP_RENDER_INTERLACED in
  MDP_Render_t.
- [MDP] Initial plugin manager UI.

TODO for Gens/GS m6.1:
- [MDP] New plugin types:
  - Audio Processing (volume control)
  - Generic (Game Genie, SGens)
- [MDP] External plugins.

High-Level TODO:
- Move most global variables to global Settings struct
- Port all Gens Rerecording changes
- Add Qt4 UI
- Convert all code to C++ with classes, etc
- [MDP] Add VGM dumping support
- Add more compression format support
- Improve the Zip File Selection Dialog

Low Priority:
- Add MacOS X Aqua UI

High-Level TODO:
- [DDraw] Border color emulation.
- Rework border color emulation to be in the MD renderer, not the blitter.
- Reimplement OpenGL projection so it doesn't stretch on widescreen monitors.
  (Make it an option?)
- [Win32] Add OpenGL renderer.
- Combine common portions of the GTK+ and Win32 UIs.
- Rework the language system.
- Combine the two versions of Starscream. (It'll still output two asms, though.)
- [Linux] Add a No GUI mode that runs in a plain SDL window.
- [Linux] Add a configure option to disable the GTK+ interface.
- Store ROM filetypes in the configuration file so they don't need to
  be checked in Sync_Gens_Window_FileMenu_ROMHistory().
- Port Linux physical CD-ROM support to libcdio. libcdio also works on
  MacOS X and BSD.
- Port MP3 support to LAME or some other MP3 library.
- Re-add v5 32X savestate load support.
- Automatically format SegaCD RAM cartridges.
- Include the reverse-engineered 32X firmware.
- [SDL] Figure out the minimum SDL version.
- [GTK+] game_genie: If Enter is pressed in a textbox, select "Add Code", not "OK".
- Pausing using Esc while in interlaced mode (Sonic 2 2P) causes the bottom
  half of the screen to screw up.
- [Win32] Windowed VSync might be broken.
- [Win32] Full Screen: Frame counter flickers.
- [Win32] Show a warning if DDraw fails due to lack of video memory.
- [Win32] Frameskip doesn't work correctly. (It completely disregards timing.)
- [ASPI] Only initialize when "Boot CD" is selected. (Also, close when SegaCD is closed.)
- Check if mingw32 forces 8-byte alignment for doubles. (ym2612 struct)
- J-Cart: http://spritesmind.net/_GenDev/forum/viewtopic.php?start=15&t=177
- [Linux] Mono sound is broken.
- [Win32] Mono sound works on Windows, but not in Wine.

Low-Level TODO:
- Fix VRAM overwrite bug, as seen in Sonic 2 Delta. Gens doesn't
  overwrite the VRAM, but Kega and the actual MD do.
- Fix Illegal Address bug. Gens doesn't crash, but Kega and the actual
  MD do. (Possible: Make an option to crash on illegal address.)
- CD audio fixes in Gens Re-Recording r65, r66, etc.
  - http://code.google.com/p/gens-rerecording/source/detail?r=65
- [MDP] Overclocking! Add an option to overclock the emulated CPUs so Sonic 2 2P doesn't lag.
- Proper support for 448 lines in interlaced mode. (Sonic 2 2P)
- Z80 initialization bug: http://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?showtopic=11192
- Erase the entire MD palette when a new ROM is loaded.
- [32X] PWM regressions from the C port, started in m5.1. PWM is broken in
  BC Racer, but BC Racer doesn't work anyway.

Miscellaneous:
- Commit fe2426a72420177fd3e7e4c086a673ec7273a97c fixed performance problems in VMware.
  This commit allows processing messages in GensUI::sleep(), which technically *shouldn't*
  fix the problem in VMware since GensUI::sleep() isn't called when a game is running.

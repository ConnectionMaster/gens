Emulator TODO:
- Fix VRAM overwrite bug, as seen in Sonic 2 Delta. Gens doesn't overwrite the VRAM, but Kega and the actual MD do.
- Fix Illegal Address bug. Gens doesn't crash, but Kega and the actual MD do. (Possible: Make an option to crash on illegal address.)
- CD audio fixes in Gens Re-Recording r65, r66, etc.
  - http://code.google.com/p/gens-rerecording/source/detail?r=65
- Overclocking! Add an option to overclock the emulated CPUs so Sonic 2 2P doesn't lag.
- Proper support for 448 lines in interlaced mode. (Sonic 2 2P)
- Set the border color to color 0 of palette 0. (See Sonic 1 GHZ for an example.)

Miscellaneous Bugs:
- Auto Pause doesn't work.
